# Basic Sudoku solver

### What is it about ?
The purpose is to solve a Sudoku grid.
It uses known techniques. The idea is to get to resolve any solvable Sudoku grid.

### How to use it ?
After compiling (e.g., CMake + Visual Studio), in the terminal, line by line, the different available numbers (and blanks) are given as input.
The script won't verify if the entered grid is correct itself. That is, even if the same number is entered twice in a row, column or square, the script will still try to solve the puzzle and won't prompt any errors.
